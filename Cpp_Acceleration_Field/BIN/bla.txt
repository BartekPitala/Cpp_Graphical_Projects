Welcome to our program! Its purpose is to draw a colored contour map of surface given as a mathematical equation.
The height of each point is counted as a function of its X and Y coordinates and time - to diversify the output.
In addition, the program can show the field of gravitational acceleration with vectors overlaying the initial map.
To visualize the acceleration, a ball can be put in the highest point of the map and its trail can be observed.

HOW TO USE:

Click "SurfaceChoice" to select one of the available surface equations. NOTE: Drawing the map may take a few seconds, so be patient!
Click "VECTORS ON/OFF" to overlay the map with vectors (arrows) pointing the directions of highest value of gravitational acceleration.
Slide the "Timeline" slider to change the value of "time" variable, thus modifying the map and contours. NOTE: Drawing the map after slide may take a few seconds.
Slide the "Number of contours" slider to alternate the number of contours drawn on the map.
Click "Save to BMP" to save the currently drawn map to a .bmp file. NOTE: The map will be saved without colors (Only contours and vectors, if enabled).
Click "Generate frames" to save 255 frames with value of time changed by 1 unit between two consecutive frames. You have to specify the directory to save.
Click "BALL ON/OFF" to release a ball in the highest point of the map. The ball starts to fall in the direction of the highest acceleration, and its trail can be observed.

Now that You know everything, go back and have fun!
