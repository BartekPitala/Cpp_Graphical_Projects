# Acceleration Field
A final project written in the course of Computer Graphics course ran on AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow. 

# Technologies & Libraries:
Written in C++ language.
Created using wxWidgets, an old and laggy library, but it was imposed by the project supervisor.
The in-app language is Polish, also imposed by the supervisor.

# Description:
The app can be used to visualize the field of acceleration on a 2D map drawn from a mathematical function (currently there are two predefined surfaces). The field is shown as vectors(arrows) with varying length, depending on the "steepness" of the surface in a given point.
The app incorporates an "About" page, where all the functionalities are explained.
More detailed documentation in DOC folder (Polish language only).

# How to start a program
Simply clone the repo and go to BIN folder. Run "Pole przyspieszen czastki GFK.exe". No need to build from source.
