# Cpp_Paint

# Description:
This application is a basic version of MS "Paint" app. It allows the user to draw simple shapes (e.g. rectangle, circle, line) with real-time preview - meaning the drawn shape follows the mouse cursor during drawing. The user can choose a drawing color from a very wide palette of colours displayed as a bar in the top of the app window. In addition, a different filling colour can be chosen.
Apart from drawing, the app allows the user to save his picture as a bitmap, or load one from disk.

# Usage:
Though the whole source code of the app is in the repository, there is no need to compile the project by yourself. To run the app, simply go to Cpp_Paint_SFML/Debug/OwnPaint.exe 
Optionally, You can build from source using MS Visual Studio.
# NOTE: Microsoft Visual Studio is needed to run the executable - required MSVCP dll's.
